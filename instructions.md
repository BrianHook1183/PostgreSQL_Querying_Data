PostgreSQL: Querying Data
Instructions
In this practice problem, you will write queries to retrieve specified data from two already populated tables.

Only one query should be written per file. Carefully check your syntax if you encounter errors. In particular, the name of the tables are very important.

Artist Queries
For each of the following files, create a query as described.

get-all-artists.sql: Write a query that will return all rows from the table.
get-artist-names.sql: Write a query that will return all rows from the table but only include the first_name and last_name fields.
get-alive-artists.sql: Write a query that will return all rows where is_alive is set to true.
get-b-artists.sql: Write ea query that will return all rows where the artist's last name begins with the letter "B".
Artwork Queries
For each of the following files, create a query as described.

get-all-artworks.sql: Write a query that will return all rows from the table.
get-artwork-descriptions.sql: Write a query that will return all rows from the table but only include the description field.
get-the-horse-fair.sql: Write a query that will return rows where the painting name equal "The Horse Fair".
